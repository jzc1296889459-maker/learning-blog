## Core idea

What I want to capture in this card is a concept that's very basic in agent systems, but becomes critical the moment you build a real product:

> **Agent Routing / Agent Route is essentially the scheduling layer in a multi-agent system that decides "who should handle this, in what order, and with what context."**

Reading it as just "dispatch requests to different agents" isn't quite enough. More precisely, it involves three things at once:

- **Task identification**: what type does the current request actually belong to
- **Capability matching**: which agent / tool / workflow should it go to
- **Execution orchestration**: is it a single hop, a multi-step chain, or a supervisor watching continuously

The explanation in the Gemini share link is very introductory but very clear:

- An Agent Route is a lot like a "front-desk triage station"
- It decides whether a request goes to the search agent, the code agent, the finance agent, or some other execution unit
- In complex tasks, it isn't just a single dispatch but possibly a continuous relay of tasks

And those two Botpress articles push this one layer further toward productization:

- One emphasizes that **routing is the brain of a multi-agent system**
- The other emphasizes that **once routing becomes dynamic, multi-layered, and multi-model, cost and latency quickly turn into system-level problems**

So I now prefer to understand this topic as:

> Agent Routing is not a small feature but the core layer in a multi-agent architecture that ties together **intent understanding, task dispatch, context passing, latency control, and cost control**.

## Key points

### 1. Agent Routing solves not "can it do this" but "who should do this"

The default assumption of a single-agent system is:

- whatever the user says
- the same agent tries to catch it all

But the moment multiple specialist roles start appearing in the system, that assumption falls apart.

For example, a system might have:

- a research agent
- a coding agent
- a browser agent
- a reporting agent
- a human escalation channel

At that point, the first problem to solve isn't whether a given agent can write a report, but:

- does the current request need search, analysis, writing, or executing an action
- is it done by a single agent, or relayed across several
- which agent is most worth calling first
- which step must be handed off to a human

In other words, routing first solves **task ownership**.

If this step is done poorly, then even if each agent is individually capable, the system as a whole will feel:

- slow to respond
- prone to taking detours
- prone to calling tools redundantly
- expensive
- like the user is getting "passed around"

### 2. Routing is already part of multi-agent

The original question had a very correct intuition:

> "This already involves multi-agent too, right?"

Yes — **and usually it's not a peripheral problem, it's the core one.**

Because as soon as you have:

- multiple specialist agents
- multiple tools
- multi-stage tasks
- a supervisor / orchestrator

routing is already the scheduling hub of the multi-agent system.

More concretely, multi-agent setups usually contain at least the following layers:

1. **Orchestrator / Router**
   - responsible for understanding how to break down the current task
   - decides who to hand it to
2. **Worker / Specialist Agents**
   - each handles a specific subtask
3. **Context Handoff Layer**
   - passes the necessary context, parameters, and history downstream
4. **Verification / Supervisor Layer**
   - checks whether the result is acceptable, and retries or reassigns when needed

So "multi-agent" isn't just a bunch of agents sitting side by side; it's these agents having a mechanism for **who goes first, who goes after, when to fall back, and when to escalate**.

The first capability to emerge within that mechanism is routing.

### 3. Common routing approaches actually fall into three categories

#### A. Static / rule-based routing

The simplest approach is:

- keyword matching
- if/else
- regex
- explicitly enumerated rules

For example:

- refund / billing appears → finance agent
- code / bug / stack trace appears → coding agent
- angry complaint appears → human escalation

Pros:

- fast
- cheap
- controllable
- easy to explain and debug

Cons:

- very brittle
- bad at handling natural-language variation
- easily wrong when faced with multiple intents, shifts in tone, or cross-turn conversation

This approach suits:

- very clear task boundaries
- a limited business space
- extremely high requirements for controllability

#### B. LLM-based semantic routing

This is also the most common approach now:

- give the model a description of the agent / tool capabilities
- let the model judge "where to go next" based on the user input and context
- output a structured routing result, for example:

```json
{"next_agent":"research_agent","reason":"user asks for competitor info before writing report"}
```

Pros:

- flexible
- understands semantics
- can handle requests that are fairly natural, fuzzy, and cross-turn

Cons:

- slower than rule-based routing
- spends extra tokens on every routing decision
- can misjudge, and can also hallucinate an inappropriate agent

So while it's powerful, abusing it turns every step into "ask the big model one more time," which ultimately leads to:

- higher latency
- higher cost
- the whole system over-relying on the router model

#### C. Hierarchical / supervisor routing

Slightly more complex systems move into hierarchical routing:

- the top-level supervisor first decides the overall direction
- a subsystem then does second-level routing internally
- after a sub-agent finishes, it returns the result to the upper layer for acceptance

This is no longer just "dispatch" but **orchestration + supervision**.

Its pros are:

- well suited to complex business flows
- you can explicitly control stages and responsibility boundaries
- easy to attach retry / validation / fallback

But the cons are equally obvious:

- complex architecture
- longer chains
- context passing is more prone to bloat
- one full task run may consume many rounds of model calls

### 4. The real hard part isn't picking the agent, it's sending the right context along with it

This point tends to get understated in a lot of "what is agent routing" explanations.

In practice, the hardest part of routing often isn't:

- "research agent or coding agent"

but:

- **which part of the context to pass to the downstream agent**
- **which history to keep, and which noise to trim**
- **whether parameters need to be standardized**
- **who continues the decision-making once the result comes back**

If handoff is done poorly, you get the classic problems:

- the sub-agent doesn't know why it was called
- the sub-agent didn't receive the key constraints
- upstream and downstream see inconsistent task descriptions
- every agent switch re-feeds a large chunk of context, wasting tokens

So routing is actually bound together with the following terms:

- orchestration
- context engineering
- state management
- tool schema design

My take is:

> In a real system, routing quality largely depends on handoff quality.

### 5. Routing design directly determines the cost structure

That Botpress cost-optimization article isn't specifically about multi-agent, but it's a very instructive read in this context.

Because one natural risk of multi-agent systems is:

> Every extra routing decision, every extra agent handoff, every extra layer of model calls — cost and latency accumulate.

A few points especially worth noting:

#### a. Don't hand every problem to the most expensive model

High-cost models should be reserved for:

- complex judgments
- high-risk branching
- high-value answers

Whatever can be solved with lighter logic shouldn't be forced onto a big model.

This means the routing layer itself should have a **cost-aware policy**:

- FAQ / clear rules → static routing
- medium-complexity intent → small model / embedding routing
- fuzzy and high-value questions → big-model router

#### b. Narrow the scope first, then call expensive capabilities

This is a lot like the idea of scoping a knowledge base.

Don't immediately have one master agent reason over all documents, all tools, and all specialist descriptions. A more sensible approach is usually:

- coarsely classify the task first
- then enter a specific subdomain
- then do finer routing within that subdomain

In other words:

> **Narrow the search space first, then do expensive reasoning.**

#### c. Don't disguise simple tasks as AI tasks

If an action is essentially just:

- a table lookup
- a rule check
- a data format conversion
- a fixed-template reply

then it should be done with code / a deterministic workflow / retrieval as much as possible.

Otherwise, the most common waste in a multi-agent system is:

- something that's clearly fixed logic
- still gets handed layer by layer to an agent to "think about"
- ultimately turning something that could finish in a few milliseconds into several rounds of LLM calls

### 6. A more practical framing: routing is the balancer of "correctness, latency, cost"

Conceptually, routing looks a lot like "smart dispatch."

But from an engineering angle, it's actually optimizing three things that conflict with one another:

#### Correctness
- pick the right agent
- pass the right context
- fall back / escalate when necessary

#### Latency
- fewer detours
- fewer redundant calls
- get the user a result as fast as possible

#### Cost
- fewer unnecessary model calls
- less repeated reasoning
- control token, tool, and external-API spend

Whether a routing design is good usually isn't about how "smart" it is, but whether it can keep an acceptable balance among these three.

### 7. Rather than a "jack-of-all-trades agent," an orchestrator + specialists is often more reasonable

There's an implicit logic in that Botpress routing article that I largely agree with:

- don't make a single agent responsible for understanding, executing, and explaining all the business at once
- the more stable approach is usually one orchestrator that judges and several specialists that execute

The benefits of doing this are:

- each agent's context window can be smaller
- prompts are more focused
- the hallucination surface is narrower
- debugging is clearer
- permission boundaries are easier to control

But it's not a free lunch.

Because once you split into multiple specialists:

- the router prompt has to be clearer
- the handoff schema has to be clearer
- logging and tracing must be better
- otherwise the system just becomes "more agents, harder to debug"

### 8. A direction well worth tracking long-term: semantic routing doesn't have to mean asking an LLM every time

Both the Gemini summary and the Botpress routing article lean toward LLM-based routing. But from a system-design view, I think what's more worth remembering is:

> Semantic routing ≠ calling an expensive big model to decide every single time.

There are quite a few alternative routes:

- embedding similarity routing
- a small classifier model
- hybrid rule + semantic routing
- staged routing (coarse classification + fine classification)

The point of these approaches is:

- retain a certain amount of semantic understanding
- while pushing latency and cost down

As a system grows, this kind of hybrid routing is often more robust than "relying entirely on one big model as the front-desk controller."

## Current understanding / conclusion

I now understand Agent Routing as the following sentence:

> **It's the scheduling kernel of a multi-agent system, responsible for deciding — across correctness, latency, and cost — how a task gets broken down, dispatched, relayed, and collected.**

What's most worth committing to memory here isn't the definition but a few judgments:

1. **Routing is itself a core multi-agent capability, not an auxiliary concept.**
2. **The real difficulty isn't just picking the agent, it's context handoff.**
3. **Routing design directly determines the cost curve.**
4. **If it can be done with rules, don't make it semantic; if it can be done lightweight, don't make it a heavy model.**
5. **A mature system looks more like orchestrator + specialists than a single jack-of-all-trades master agent.**

## Implications for actual work

If I ever design an agent system myself, I think the routing layer should at minimum answer these questions clearly first:

### 1. What is the unit of routing?
- route to an agent
- route to a tool
- route to a workflow
- or route to a human

### 2. What is routing based on?
- keywords
- schema
- embeddings
- small-model classification
- big-model judgment
- a hybrid strategy

### 3. What is the minimal context for handoff?
- the goal
- the constraints
- completed steps
- key intermediate results
- prohibited actions

### 4. How does fallback work?
- ask a clarifying question
- switch agents
- downgrade to a rule-based flow
- escalate to a human

### 5. What is the cost policy?
- which requests aren't worth going multi-agent for
- which requests must be routed conservatively
- which requests are worth calling a high-cost model for

## To be added

Directions still worth fleshing out later:

1. The specific abstractions LangGraph / CrewAI / Botpress each use for routing
2. How a context handoff schema should be designed so it doesn't get bloated
3. Which key nodes multi-agent tracing / observability should record
4. The applicability boundaries of an embedding router, a small-model router, and a big-model router
5. The relationship between routing and permission control / prompt injection risk
